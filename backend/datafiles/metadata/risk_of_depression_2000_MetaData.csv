7,"Data with a coefficient of variation (CV) greater than 33.3% were suppressed (F) due to extreme sampling variability."
8,"Health regions are defined by provincial governments as the areas of responsibility for regional health boards (i.e., legislated) or as regions of interest to health care authorities."

21,"The following standard symbols are used in Statistics Canada publications: (..) for figures not available for a specific reference period and (...) for figures not applicable."
22,"The table (105-0005) was archived due to a change in geography.  More recent data are in table (105-0205)."
70,"In 2002, the British Columbia Ministry of Health changed the health region boundaries from 20 health regions to 16 health service delivery areas. The new regions are coded from 5911 to 5953 and are also identified with the reference date as part of the health region name."
