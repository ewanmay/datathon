1,"Source: Statistics Canada, Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)"
2,"All estimates in this table are calculated excluding non-response categories (""refusal"", ""don't know"", and ""not stated"") in the denominator."
3,"Data for the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) are collected yearly from a sample of approximately 65,000 respondents. The Canadian Health Indicators are tabulated by sex and age group in two main tables. The table 13-10-0096-01 presents the most up-to-date population health estimates for the ten provinces and is updated yearly. The table 13-10-0113-01 (to be released in autumn of 2017) presents estimates from two-year combined data and features breakdowns by all provinces and territories as well as by health regions. These estimates are less current than annual estimates, but have higher precision given the larger sample (less variability). Users should refer to the annual data table 13-10-0096-01 as the primary source for the most current estimates from the survey as well as to obtain data from previous years (where available). However, where data quality flags indicate suppression (F) or higher variability (E), the two-year data table 13-10-0113-01 should be used."
4,"Population aged 12 and over who reported perceiving their own health status as being either excellent or very good or fair or poor, depending on the indicator. Perceived health refers to the perception of a person's health in general, either by the person himself or herself, or, in the case of proxy response, by the person responding. Health means not only the absence of disease or injury but also physical, mental and social well-being."
5,"Population aged 12 and over who reported perceiving their own mental health status as being excellent or very good or fair or poor, depending on the indicator. Perceived mental health refers to the perception of a person's mental health in general. Perceived mental health provides a general indication of the population suffering from some form of mental disorder, mental or emotional problems, or distress, not necessarily reflected in perceived health."
6,"Population aged 12 and over who reported perceiving that most days in their life were quite a bit or extremely stressful. Perceived life stress refers to the amount of stress in the person's life, on most days, as perceived by the person or, in the case of proxy response, by the person responding."
7,"Body mass index (BMI) is a method of classifying body weight according to health risk. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Health Canada guidelines, health risk levels are associated with each of the following BMI categories: normal weight = least health risk; underweight and overweight = increased health risk; obese, class I = high health risk; obese, class II = very high health risk; obese, class III = extremely high health risk."
8,"Body mass index (BMI) is calculated by dividing the respondent's body weight (in kilograms) by their height (in metres) squared."
9,"Body mass index (BMI) is calculated for the population aged 12 and over, excluding pregnant females and persons less than 3 feet (0.914 metres) tall or greater than 6 feet 11 inches (2.108 metres)."
10,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Health Canada guidelines, the index for body weight classification for the population aged 18 and older is: less than 18.50 (underweight); 18.50 to 24.99 (normal weight); 25.00 to 29.99 (overweight); 30.00 to 34.99 (obese, class I); 35.00 to 39.99 (obese, class II); 40.00 or greater (obese, class III). The population aged 12 to 17 is classified as ""severely obese"", ""obese"", or ""overweight"" according to age and sex specific cut-off points defined by the World Health Organization."
11,"A systematic review of the literature concluded that the use of self-reported data among adults underestimates weight and overestimates height, resulting in lower estimates of obesity than those obtained from measured data. Using data from the 2005 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) subsample, where both measured and self-reported height and weight were collected, BMI correction equations have been developed. This table presents obesity estimates adjusted using these equations."
12,"The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) - Annual, the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) and the 2015 CCHS - Nutrition, all collect height and weight data and derive obesity rates based on Body Mass Index (BMI). Users should take note of the data collection method, the target population and the classification system used by each survey in order to select the appropriate data set."
13,"Population aged 15 and over who reported that they have been diagnosed by a health professional as having arthritis. Arthritis includes osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, but excludes fibromyalgia."
14,"Population aged 12 and over who reported that they have been diagnosed by a health professional as having Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, including females 15 and over who reported that they have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes."
15,"Population aged 12 and over who reported that they have been diagnosed by a health professional as having asthma."
16,"Population aged 35 and over who reported being diagnosed by a health professional with chronic bronchitis, emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)."
17,"The Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) and the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) - Annual both collect data on the prevalence of COPD and high blood pressure. Users should take note of the data collection method and the target population of each survey in order to select the appropriate data set."
18,"Population aged 12 and over who reported that they have been diagnosed by a health professional as having high blood pressure."
19,"Population aged 12 and over who reported that they have been diagnosed by a health professional as having a mood disorder, such as depression, bipolar disorder, mania or dysthymia."
20,"Population aged 12 and over who reported being a current smoker. Does not take into account the number of cigarettes smoked."
21,"Data collected for this indicator is based on the question referring to smoking of cigarettes only. Note that data on smoking alternative tobacco products is captured in a different module (TAL)."
22,"Daily smoker refers to those who reported smoking cigarettes every day."
23,"Statistics Canada has two main surveys that produce national and provincial smoking rates. The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), and the Canadian Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey (CTADS), which replaces the Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring Survey (CTUMS) beginning in 2013. Users should be aware of a number of differences between CCHS and CTADS. CCHS collects information from respondents aged 12 and over, CTADS collects information from respondents aged 15 and over; the two surveys use different sampling frames; the annual sample for CTADS is 20,000 compared to 65,000 for CCHS; in CCHS, smoking questions are asked in the context of a wide range of health-related behaviours whereas in CTADS, all questions are related to the use of multiple products and substances with addictive properties. Although these factors can influence the estimates produced at a single point in time, the trends produced by the two surveys have been noted to be very consistent over time. Rather than comparing smoking rates produced from the two surveys, Statistics Canada advises users to choose a single source, based on their objectives, and to use that source consistently."
24,"Occasional smoker refers to those who reported smoking cigarettes occasionally. This includes former daily smokers who now smoke occasionally."
25,"Heavy drinking refers to males who reported having 5 or more drinks, or women who reported having 4 or more drinks, on one occasion, at least once a month in the past year."
26,"Canadians aged 18 and over. Based on the number of minutes of physical activity reported in the last 7 days. Indicates whether adults are physically active, meaning that they participate in at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity per week, in bouts of 10 minutes or more. Moderate exercise is defined as an activity that causes a person to breathe harder and sweat at least a little."
27,"Canadians aged 12 to 17. Based on the number of minutes of physical activity reported in the last 7 days. Indicates whether a youth is physically active by practicing an average of 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity each day. Moderate exercise is defined as an activity that causes a person to breathe harder and sweat at least a little."
28,"Based on information provided by females aged 15 to 55 who had a baby in the last 5 years."
29,"Initiated breastfeeding refers to mothers who breastfed or tried to breastfeed their last child, or gave breastmilk to their last child even if only for a short time."
30,"Exclusive breastfeeding refers to an infant receiving only breast milk, without any additional liquid (even water) or solid food."
31,"The numerator includes mothers who have exclusively breastfed for at least 6 months and who may or may not be still breastfeeding. The denominator includes all mothers who had a baby in the past 5 years but excludes mothers who were still breastfeeding and who had not introduced any other liquids or solid foods to the baby's feeds."
32,"Indicates the usual number of times (frequency) per day a person reported eating fruits and vegetables. Measure does not take into account the amount consumed. This includes pure fruit juice, frozen or canned fruits and vegetables, and dried fruit, but excludes fried potatoes."
33,"Population aged 12 and over who reported their sense of belonging to their local community as being very strong or somewhat strong. Research shows a high correlation of sense of community-belonging with physical and mental health."
34,"Population aged 12 and over who reported being satisfied or very satisfied with their life in general. Life satisfaction is based on a self-reported score from 0 to 10 for how respondents feel about their life as a whole at the moment. Satisfied or very satisfied represents those who indicated a value of 6 or more out of 10."
35,"Population aged 12 and over who have a health care provider they regularly see or talk to when they need normal care or advice for their health."
36,"Population aged 12 and over who reported having consulted with a medical doctor in the past 12 months."
37,"Medical doctor includes family or general practitioners as well as specialists such as surgeons, allergists, orthopaedists, gynaecologists, urologists or psychiatrists. For population aged 12 to 17, includes pediatricians."
38,"The confidence interval illustrates the degree of variability associated with a rate. Wide confidence intervals indicate high variability, thus, these rates should be interpreted with due caution. When comparing estimates, it is important to use confidence intervals to determine if differences between values are statistically significant."
39,"Bootstrapping techniques were used to produce the 95% confidence intervals (CIs)."
40,"Data with a coefficient of variation (CV) from 15.1% to 35.0% are identified as follows: (E) use with caution."
41,"Data with a coefficient of variation (CV) greater than 35.0% or that did not meet the minimum sample size requirement were suppressed due to extreme sampling variability and are identified as follows: (F) too unreliable to be published."
42,"The following standard symbols are used in this Statistics Canada table: (..) for figures not available for a specific reference period and (...) for figures not applicable."
43,"Percentages are rounded to the nearest tenth. Numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred."
44,"Census population counts have been used to produce the population projection counts. These counts are used to ensure that the CCHS survey weights and resulting estimates included in this table are consistent with known population totals."
45,"This variable provides direction and statistical significance of the difference between estimates (p < 0.05). A value of +1 means the difference observed is significantly higher, -1 means the difference is significantly lower and 0 means the difference is not statistically significant."
46,"Due to content changes, this indicator is now derived from data collected from an optional content module (based on provincial and territorial selection). This change occurred in 2017."
47,"As a result of the 2015 redesign, CCHS has a new collection strategy, a new sample design, and has undergone major content revisions. With all these factors taken together, caution should be taken when comparing data from previous cycles to data released for the 2015 cycle onwards."
48,"Population aged 12 and over who reported having their last influenza immunization (flu shot) in the past 12 months."
